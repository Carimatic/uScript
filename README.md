# uScript
Overly basic Ubuntu 16/18/20 hardening script I made in 2021-22 for CyberPatriot. Because I am **no longer** a competitor, this script has been made open for anyone to improve on.

# Usage
- Download **uScript.sh** in your sandbox and read it from start to finish before running.
- If the script breaks something that wasn't accounted for, restart your image.
